# 2.2 Azure Compute and Networking Services

## **Introduction**
Azure provides a range of compute and networking services to help businesses deploy scalable, secure, and high-performance applications. These services include **Virtual Machines (VMs), Containers, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Functions**, and **various networking options** like Virtual Networks (VNets), Peering, VPN Gateway, and ExpressRoute.

---

## **Azure Compute Services**
Azure offers multiple compute options tailored to different workloads, ranging from **virtual machines for flexible computing power** to **serverless computing for event-driven execution**.

### **1. Virtual Machines (VMs)**
Azure **Virtual Machines (VMs)** provide scalable computing capacity in the cloud. They allow users to:
- Deploy Windows and Linux operating systems.
- Choose from different **VM sizes** to match their workload.
- Scale horizontally (adding more VMs) or vertically (upgrading VM resources).

#### **Common Use Cases:**
- Hosting websites and applications.
- Running databases and enterprise workloads.
- Disaster recovery and backup solutions.

#### **Examples of Azure VM Services:**
- **Azure Virtual Machines** (Standard compute instances)
- **Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)** (Auto-scaling for high availability)
- **Azure Spot VMs** (Low-cost compute for batch jobs and workloads)

---

### **2. Containers and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
Containers package applications along with their dependencies, allowing **fast, portable, and efficient deployments**.

#### **Azure Container Services:**
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** Managed Kubernetes service for orchestrating containers.
- **Azure Container Instances (ACI):** Serverless container deployment without infrastructure management.
- **Azure App Service (for Containers):** Hosting web applications with container support.

#### **Common Use Cases:**
- Microservices architecture.
- Scaling applications dynamically.
- CI/CD automation for application deployment.

---

### **3. Azure Functions and Serverless Computing**
**Azure Functions** enable **event-driven computing** without needing to manage infrastructure.

#### **Key Features:**
- Executes code **on demand** (e.g., HTTP triggers, database updates, IoT events).
- Supports multiple programming languages (C#, Python, Java, etc.).
- Automatically scales based on workload.

#### **Common Use Cases:**
- Automating workflows and backend processing.
- Running lightweight API endpoints.
- Real-time data processing.

#### **Other Serverless Offerings:**
- **Azure Logic Apps:** Automates workflows between services.
- **Azure Event Grid:** Handles event routing.
- **Azure Service Bus:** Manages messaging between applications.

---

## **Azure Networking Services**
Networking in Azure ensures **secure, fast, and scalable connectivity** between services, applications, and users.

### **1. Virtual Networks (VNets)**
Azure **Virtual Networks (VNets)** allow Azure resources to securely communicate with each other and on-premises networks.

#### **Key Features:**
- Provides **IP address segmentation**.
- Supports network isolation with **subnets**.
- Enables traffic filtering via **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**.

#### **Common Use Cases:**
- Hosting multi-tier applications securely.
- Connecting on-premises and Azure workloads.
- Segmenting applications using subnets.

---

### **2. Azure Peering**
**Peering** connects Azure virtual networks, allowing resources in different VNets to communicate without routing through the public internet.

#### **Types of Peering:**
- **VNet Peering:** Connects two Azure VNets within the same or different regions.
- **Global VNet Peering:** Connects VNets across different Azure regions.

#### **Common Use Cases:**
- Multi-region applications requiring low-latency communication.
- Cross-subscription resource sharing.

---

### **3. Azure VPN Gateway**
Azure **VPN Gateway** enables secure connections between on-premises networks and Azure VNets over the public internet using encrypted tunnels.

#### **Key Features:**
- Supports **IPsec/IKE** encryption.
- Enables **hybrid connectivity** between Azure and on-premises.
- Provides **policy-based and route-based VPN configurations**.

#### **Common Use Cases:**
- Secure remote access for corporate employees.
- Connecting branch offices to cloud workloads.

---

### **4. Azure ExpressRoute**
Azure **ExpressRoute** provides a **private, dedicated connection** between an on-premises network and Azure, bypassing the public internet.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Lower latency and higher security** than standard VPNs.
- **Guaranteed bandwidth options** (50 Mbps to 100 Gbps).
- **Direct integration with Microsoft cloud services** (Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365).

#### **Common Use Cases:**
- Secure, high-speed data transfer for enterprises.
- Disaster recovery and hybrid cloud solutions.
